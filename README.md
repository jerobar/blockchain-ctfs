## Democracy

Democracy NFT: One hodler, one vote!

You are the current challenger candidate in the latest "Democracy NFT" election. The project is committed to perfecting fair and democratic on-chain voting in the NFT space. It even pays each hodler to vote!

Each NFT hodler can vote for their preferred nominee and the winner will become the new contract owner. The only problem is that the current incumbent has rigged the outcome to ensure that once your vote has been cast, the election will end with them as the winner...

Your goal is to drain the contract's entire balance.

## Forge

You've been contacted by a team developing an ERC1155 contract written entirely in Yul. They would like some assistance with their new "forging" feature, which will allow users to forge two or more tokens of the same id into the coveted '42' token. Right away, you notice something seems a little off...

Starting with a single token id '1', your goal is to forge a '42' token.
